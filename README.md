A small sleep obfuscation technique that uses `CreateTimerQueueTimer` Win32 API. <br>
Proof of Concept. Can be done better. <br>

### NOTE
This implementation has known flawes. <br> 
So I wouldn't recommend using it without knowing how it works or know how to spot and fix those flaws. <br>
TLDR: don't copy and past it into your implants.
